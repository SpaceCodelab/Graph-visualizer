## ✨ Highlights

- Multiple coloring algorithms: Greedy (largest-first, smallest-last, random), Welsh–Powell, DSATUR, Backtracking (exact for small graphs)
- Graph generators: complete, bipartite, cycle, path, planar-ish, Erdős–Rényi, and special graphs
- Interactive visualizer (Plotly + Streamlit) and static export (Matplotlib)
- Benchmarking harness to compare runtime and quality across algorithms
- Command-line and programmatic APIs

## 🚀 Quickstart (Windows PowerShell)

Clone, create a venv, install, and run the Streamlit UI:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/SpaceCodelab/Graph-visualizer.git "Graph Project"
cd "Graph Project"
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the URL shown by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).

pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the URL shown by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).

Tip: on Windows Command Prompt use `.\.venv\Scripts\activate` instead of the PowerShell command.

## 🧩 Quick example (programmatic)

Use the library modules directly from Python scripts or REPL:

```python
from src.graph_generator import GraphGenerator
from src.algorithms import ColoringSolver

g = GraphGenerator().complete_graph(6)
solver = ColoringSolver(g)
res = solver.solve('dsatur')
print('colors used', res['num_colors'])
print(res['coloring'])
```

## 🛠 Development & Tests

Run the test suite (inside the activated virtualenv):

```powershell
pytest -q
```

Linting and static checks can be added via `flake8`/`ruff`/`mypy` if desired.

# Generate a graph
generator = GraphGenerator()
graph = generator.complete_graph(5)

# Solve coloring
solver = ColoringSolver(graph)
result = solver.solve('dsatur')

print(f"Number of colors: {result['num_colors']}")

# Visualize
visualizer = Visualizer(graph)
fig = visualizer.visualize_coloring_plotly(result['coloring'])

## Algorithm Complexity

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Optimal |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| Greedy (Largest-First) | O(V + E) | O(V) | No |
| Greedy (Smallest-Last) | O(V²) | O(V) | No |
| Welsh-Powell | O(V²) | O(V) | No |
| DSATUR | O(V²) | O(V) | No |
| Backtracking | O(V * k^V) | O(V) | Yes (for small graphs) |
| ILP | Exponential (worst case) | O(V²) | Yes |

Where:
- V = number of vertices
- E = number of edges
- k = number of colors

## Best and Worst Cases

### Greedy Algorithms
- **Best Case**: Trees and bipartite graphs (2 colors)
- **Worst Case**: Complete graphs (n colors for n vertices)

### DSATUR
- **Best Case**: Similar to greedy, but often uses fewer colors
- **Worst Case**: Still not optimal, but better than simple greedy

### Backtracking
- **Best Case**: Small graphs with low chromatic number
- **Worst Case**: Large graphs (exponential time)

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid input formats
- Disconnected graphs
- Self-loops (not allowed in simple graphs)
- Multigraphs (handled appropriately)
- Invalid algorithm parameters
- File I/O errors

All errors provide informative messages and suggestions for correction.
